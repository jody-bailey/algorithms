# Algorithms

This repo is a work in progress. It will be used as a way to track my progress re-learning algorithms since it has been a while. 

The plan is to work through [Introduction to Algorithms](https://a.co/d/gGKnQc8) and as I learn each algorithm, I will add the algorithm to this Go module.

## Algorithms Covered So Far
- [ ] [Insertion Sort](./insertion-sort.go)
- [ ] [Merge Sort](./merge-sort.go)
